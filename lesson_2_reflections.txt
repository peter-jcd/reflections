What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder is created with files and subfolders. I did it because you told me.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It does not contain all the files. It gives you more control. You may be finished with one file but not another.
