How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was possible to do this quickly and thoroughly

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You quickly learn from your mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Con is you may forget to take a commit for too long (due to getting carried away).
	Pro is that you can limit the commits to be at important times.
	Also you can limit the commits to be when compilation is possible.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Philosophy behind.
	Git thinks of the files as part of a bigger project, and it's the project that is the focus of your version control.
	Others think of files individually, and each one is individually the focus of version control.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use "git log" to see the different versions (with accompanying note).
	Then use "git diff" to compare the two versions you are interested in.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can undo the change if it does not work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
