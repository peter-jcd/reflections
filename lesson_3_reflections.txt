When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want a remote back-up, are working on multiple computers or are collaborating with someone.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When you are making changes that are not ready to be published or when someone else is also making changes at the same time.
