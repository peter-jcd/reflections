When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want a remote back-up, are working on multiple computers or are collaborating with someone.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When you are making changes that are not ready to be published or when someone else is also making changes at the same time.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks copies someone else's repository on github to make a new repository of your own on github, used when you want to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own. Clone is used to copy a repository from one place to another, allowing you to edit/store the repository in multiple places. Branch is used to experiment with different versions of the same project (within the same repository).


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can easily see how much has changed since the last sync with the remote.
